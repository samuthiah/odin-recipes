    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A basic white curry, this dish takes very little time to make but explodes with flavors. It is highly recommended that you use whole spices rather than ground unless otherwise noted - it will make a world of difference in the final taste. Note: recipe from <i>Rambutan</i> by Cynthia Shanmugalingam.
